# Millionerzy
This is a short program created by our team (Iryna, Bartek, Viktoriya, Honorata). That game is modeled on a TV show "Who wants to be a millionaire?" A player enters the game and has 0 zlotych. In the game are 12 questions to the first prize. Each features four possible answers, in which the contestant must give the correct answer. The player has three lifelines, that he may use only once to help them with a question. There are: ask the audience, phone to friend and 50:50 (that option rejects two false answers). The player can resign from the game if he wants. Two thresholds are guarantee: 1000 zlotych and 40 000 zlotych. We created that as a program which is based on a few functions. All of the functions answer for one of the functions of the game (lifelines, asking, answering).

It is in 3.7 Python version.
