# Millionerzy
This is short programme created by our team (Iryna, Bartek, Viktoriya, Honorata). 
That game is modeled on the television version game show "Who wants to be a millionaire?"
A player enter to the game and has 0 zlotych. In the game are 12 question to the first prize. Each features four possible answers, in which the contestant must give the correct answer.
The player has a three lifelines, that he may use only once to help them with a question. There are: ask the audience, phone to friend and 50:50 (that option rejects two false answers). 
The player can resign from the game, if he wants. Two thresholds are guarantee: 1000 zlotych and 40 000 zlotych. 
We created that as programme which is based on the a few of functions. All of functions answer for one of the functions of game (lifelines, asking, answering). 
 
It is in 3.6 Python version.
